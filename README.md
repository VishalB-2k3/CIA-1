According to this graph, this is a directed graph.
According to the concept, the prims graph wont work on Directed Weighted Graph but in this scenario prims method works because in this graph while using prims method after E node the nodes doesnt go to D node which omits the -5 which satisfies the Prims Method 

Note :
       Prims only works for this scneario graph and its not applicable for any other Generic Directed Weighted Graph
